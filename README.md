QT game:

How to Play:
  The game’s controls are very simple: the user moves around with the arrow keys; when the user is not facing the direction he has elected to press, the player first shifts his gaze in that direction.  Subsequent button presses will move the user.  To shoot, the user presses the space bar.  To reload, she presses “r”.  To change weapons, “q” is used.
	The user is randomly bestowed with guns.  Each gun has its advantages and disadvantages, thus, it is up to the user’s dexterity to switch between them accordingly.  
	As a general tip, kill spitters quickly.  Also, use Q more than R... its better to change guns, since your inventory of guns is constantly increasing!
